<h2>Lahore</h2>
<p>The <b>second largest city </b>in Pakistan after Karachi, Lahore is located in a fertile region of the upper Indus River plain. The city sits on the banks of the Ravi, a tributary of the Indus. To the east are the Shalimar Gardens. Laid out in 1641 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, these 42-acre (17-hectare) gardens are magnificent. The Mela Chiraghan (Festival of Lamps) is held there each March to herald the advent of spring.>

Known for its historical monuments and gardens, Lahore is also an educational center, with two universities and numerous colleges and institutes. The University of Punjab, established in 1882, is the oldest university in Pakistan. Other sites include the Lahore Museum and the Imperial Mosque that was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1670. The old city of Lahore is surrounded by walls, and the 15th- and 16th-century buildings are surrounded by narrow, winding streets.

The textile industry has long been the most important in Lahore. There are also many rubber factories and mills where iron, gold, and steel are produced. Gold and silver handicrafts made by local craftsmen have become well known. Railways link Lahore with the urban centers of Pakistan, and air travel has increased within the country.

The city of Lahore was the capital of the Punjab for more than 900 years. Its golden age began under the Mughals after they captured the city in 1524. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Lahore was often the place of royal residence. The city was under British rule from 1849 to 1947, when the Indian subcontinent gained independence. In 1955 Lahore was selected as the capital of the newly created province of West Pakistan. After West Pakistan was divided into four provinces in 1970, Lahore became the capital of the new Punjab
